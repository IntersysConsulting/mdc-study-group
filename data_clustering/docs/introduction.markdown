# Data Clustering

## What is Data Clustering?

*Data clustering* is a process of assigning a set of records into subsets, called *clusters*, such taht records in the same cluster are similar and records in different clusters are quite distinct. It is also know as:

+ Cluster analysis
+ Segmentation analysis
+ Taxonomy analysis
+ *Unsupervised classification*

A typical clustering process involves the following five steps:

1. Pattern Representation. The number and type of attributes are determined. May involve *Feature Selection* and *Feature Extraction*.
2. Dissimilarity measure definition. Select a distance measure appropriate to the data domain.
3. Clustering. Choose a clustering algorithm: hard vs fuzzy, hierarchical vs partitional.
4. Data abstraction. Select one or more prototypes of a cluster so that clustering results are easy to comprehend.
5. Assessment of output. External/Internal/Relative.
